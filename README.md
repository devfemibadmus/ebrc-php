## App Background

Two years ago, faced with frequent power supply issues in my living compound, I created the EBRSNG app. Designed with [ebrsng-flutter](https://github.com/devfemibadmus/ebrsng-flutter) for the frontend and PHP for the backend, the app allowed users to earn rewards by completing tasks and watching ads. In just two months, we generated $149 from Google AdMob, helping us cope with the challenges of power supply.

Though I deleted the app last year, I've decided to bring it back. I invite anyone interested in replicating the idea or contributing to the project to contact me for updated requirements.

## App Statistics

- **Play Store Availability**: The app is available on the Play Store with over 50 downloads.
- **App Depreciated**: The app is depreciated bcus the backend server is no longer.
